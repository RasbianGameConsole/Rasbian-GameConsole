# Rasbian-GameConsole
This project is focussed on creating a Rasberry Pi powered game console where games can be loaded and created using multiple different programming languages  

Our following project will be focussed on implementing versions of Java, C++,Python, and many others. Starting games and systems Development will consist of trying to create an operating engine adapted to different forms of languages and games we create. The following is the working version of what we have established via the Rasberry Pi.

This project uses the Raspberry Pi 3B+ with the Raspbian OS. The end objective is to have a functional gaming console that is completely open sorce for the world of gamers and developers to enjoy. Also there are plans to support mobile phones as game controllers. 

We have two pi's for testing but please feel free reach out if you want help setting up your own pi to work on. The idea would be for everyone to meet somehow but it is perfectly understandable that not everyone can meet all the time.

Initially we came up with some initial needs for the project to come to life. These are not set in stone so feel free to add other things to support if you want:

1. A main application with UI(C++/Qt)
2. Start up scripts to run only the main application
3. Mobile apps with ui for controller designs(Swift/Objective-C,Java,Kotlin)
4. Classes for apps to send events through usb/lightning(Objective-C,Java,Kotlin,C++)
5. device drivers to read events from mobile apps as key strokes(arrows,a,s,d,w) (C)
6. Games (Python,Java,Lua,C++,others)
7. Testing tools(python, c/c++, java, others)
8. More Ideas.

This project was created by CS Students for  CS Students to solidify programming and software engineering skills. The main idea is to have fun, share our ideas, and display our new skills. With that there three rules:

1. Please write readable code
2. Communicate before pushing so work isnt lost (Pull requrests preferred)
3. Challenge yourself and have fun
