I'm assuming it's really up in the air as to what kind of games there will/should be included in this console.

Granted, if we want to include various emulators, we're going to need to run some kind of supported OS for this system, I suggest
  a lightweight Linux distro like Mint or Ubuntu(barebones) but either way we might be able to have our console boot off of various
  portable harddrives that include all the different kinds of games we want.

I'm also apart of a group called Xenia that's working on an XBOX 360 Emulator (granted you need to do the game reading yourself)
  I think it would be a good idea to include the option for various emulators on this console, I didn't attend the previous meeting,
  so I'm not aware of what's being planned on implemented into this but I think the backend should be able to autoexec a GUI of various
  dirs/console emulators.
  
Here's the link to some of the emulators I had in mind:

Xenia - XBOX 360: 
  discord - https://discordapp.com/invite/Q9mxZf9
  subreddit - /r/xenia/
  github project - ~.com/xenia-project/xenia
  
Citrus - 3DS Emulator
  info and discord - https://citra-emu.org/discord/
  
Visual Boy Advance - GBA Emulator
  main site - http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html
  
That last link has a site to Emulator Zone which I don't have much time/experience in, 
  but if it peaks your fancy you can always peruse it
